                    <h3 class="speaker-name" style="text-align:left;color:black;">TBA</h3>
                    <p class="main_p body-text">In 2004, Dr. Harris' team submitted a grant proposal to the Canadian Space Agency as they wanted to look at the effects of weightlessness on the factors that contribute to our sense of up. Their software (on a single DVD, weighing a couple of ounces) was delivered to the ISS on March 15, 2009 onboard STS-119. The software enabled their experiment to be run on a display system, the Cogni-Hood that was already up there. The first astronaut subject blasted off a few days later and, over the course of the next year and a half, data was collected from seven astronauts who each spent an average of 168 days in space, following up with post-flight measures a few weeks or months after they returned to Earth. Dr. Harris’ talk will describe his experiences in running the Bodies in the Space Environment (BISE) experiment and what was found.</p>

                    <p class="main_p body-text">Capability in space is becoming more and more of a national responsibility as orbital and interplanetary mission efforts are brought to the forefront. 'Starting a Canadian Rocket Company' will illustrate upon the motivations and widespread impact of developing a domestic orbital launch capability. Most notably, it's argued that national support of a launch program is necessary to maintain relevancy in space. Suggestions will be made regarding possible financial and engineering solutions, and conclusions will be drawn upon the feasibility of developing a Canadian rocket company.</p>

                    <h3 class="speaker-name" style="text-align:left;">Kate Howells</h3>
                    <p class="main_p body-text">Like many of The Planetary Society's members, Kate’s interest in space exploration was inspired by the work of Carl Sagan. After reading Cosmos and tearing through the television series, she was hooked. While finishing her degree in Experimental Psychology at McGill University in Montreal, Kate took elective courses in planetary science and physics, always hungry for more insight into the reality around her. After graduating, she followed this interest and enrolled in a MA in Space Policy at George Washington University, focusing her work on public engagement and education. She put this degree on hold after one year, coming on board with The Planetary Society to coordinate the expansion of its work in her native Canada.</p>

                    <p class="main_p body-text">As National Coordinator, Kate works to connect The Planetary Society with Canadian universities, clubs, science centers and other organizations whose outreach and research efforts complement those of the Society. She is building a team of Outreach Coordinators across the country, and developing partnerships with the space societies already active in Canada. Above all else, her goal is to expand membership in Canada, building a strong community of Canadians engaged in the adventure of space exploration.</p>

                    <p class="main_p body-text">Kate also works with The Planetary Society as Volunteer Network Manager. In this role she engages with active Outreach Coordinators, creates tools and resources to support their work and seeks opportunities to grow the Global Volunteer Network. </p>

                    <p class="main_p body-text">When considering the human experience of space, we must look beyond the experience of the scientists, engineers and astronauts participating directly in space programs. The experience of average citizens is also important, because they as taxpayers are the ones ultimately supporting most of these programs. The Planetary Society focuses on elevating the experience of space for ordinary people. </p>

                    <p class="main_p body-text">A self-sufficient lunar colony requires expansive and robust infrastructure. The infrastructure build-out must have a logical path that accommodates funding contingencies and risk exigencies. As well, it must show some practical usage, or return on investment as early as possible. To meet this, we envision designing infrastructure as a series of building blocks that will combine in to a more capable and enduring facility. The first building block is a relay station that will serve to connect people on Earth with the residents of the Moon once there. However, rather than designing the building blocks and the overall infrastructure, we are preparing requirements so that for contractors to offer proposals. The requirements will mandate an expansive and robust infrastructure that will accommodate vagaries in funding.</p>

                    <p class="main_p body-text">The links between science fiction and the real-life space program are implicit and numerous. This presentation will show how the connections between the technical side of the space industry and the human experience combine to influence works of science fiction. Public attitudes to science, our knowledge of the Universe, science and technology, and aerospace professionals all inspire works of science fiction. In turn, science fiction can influence aerospace careers, perceptions of the space program, politics and funding, and space missions themselves. The presentation will conclude with a look at the links between science fiction and the ongoing exploration of the planet Mars.</p>
